\section*{Abstract}

Event generators and simulations of proton-proton collisions in high-energy/particle physics are an integral component in the advancement of our knowledge of the fundamentals of the universe. They and the theoretical frameworks they are based on provide confirmation for what is observed in experiment and provide a means to make predictions once the framework and models are validated, providing a direction for future experiments to go in to make discoveries. The monumental discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Geneva, Switzerland, was directly fueled by results from simulations. I have implemented a simplified version of such an event generator simulation, focusing only on leading order results, in which I will model two subprocesses: the hard scattering and parton showering processes. The hard scattering process centers around the Monte Carlo algorithm as a method to estimate the main cross section integral and provide a means to generate physically valid events, and the parton shower revolves around the Sudakov form factor, a means of predicting when the quark will radiate away a gluon. We find very high accuracy in the cross section calculation and strong qualitative agreement for the parton showering results with other models in the field and general physical expectations.
