# Pyresias

<h1>A toy parton shower for educational purposes.</h1>

<h2>Pre-requisites:</h2>
<ol>
<li>python 3.x</li>
<li>pyhepmc</li>
<li>matplotlib, numpy, scipy.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Usage:</h2>

There are three main files in this tutorial: 

1. The "test" code, providing a basic demonstration of the parton shower sudakov veto algorithm: 

```
python3 pyresias_test.py -n [Number of Branches] -Q [Starting scale] -c
[Cutoff Scale] -o [outputdirectory] -d [enable debugging output]
```

2. The JupyterLab notebook ```jupyter_nb.ipynb```, which includes a step-by-step guide of the above "test" code:

3. The parton shower on $e^+ e^- \rightarrow q\bar{q}$ LHE files: 

```
python3 pyresias.py data/LHE_FILE.lhe.gz
```

An example LHE file is provided in the "data" directory, generated through MadGraph5_aMC@NLO.
