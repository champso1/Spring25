Here I list the dependencies for this project, in case you need to query online for additional instructions for a system that this manual doesn\textquotesingle{}t cover. Though, if you are on a system other than Windows, for which I give (I hope) sufficient documentation, you could probably figure it out yourself.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape C/\+C++ compiler and CMake}\+: to build the project.
\item {\itshape Doxygen}\+: for generating HTML/\+PDF documentation for the project.
\item {\itshape Graphviz}\+: a "{}dependency"{} of Doxygen for making visual diagrams of the components in the project.
\item {\itshape Gnuplot}\+: A GNU plotting tool that is relatively lightweight and simple to use.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{_building_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Unix-\/like (Linux, Mac)}{Unix-\/like (Linux, Mac)}}\label{_building_autotoc_md1}
Install the above dependencies via your system\textquotesingle{}s package manager. For instance, if using a Debian-\/based distro, you\textquotesingle{}d type\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo\ apt\ install\ build-\/essential\ cmake\ doxygen\ graphviz\ gnuplot}

\end{DoxyCode}


Then, clone the repository somewhere, cd into it and do the usual CMake stuff\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{mkdir\ build\ \&\&\ cd\ build}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake\ ..}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake\ -\/-\/build\ .}

\end{DoxyCode}


After it compiles, you will have an executable called {\bfseries{NAME}}.\hypertarget{_building_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Windows}{Windows}}\label{_building_autotoc_md2}
Preferably, do this within WSL, then you can follow the Unix-\/like instructions (and simply copy-\/paste the package installation command).\hypertarget{_building_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{MSYS2}{MSYS2}}\label{_building_autotoc_md3}
I have found, though, that MSYS2 works pretty well. Installation instructions can be found online. I prefer (and it is recommended to use) the UCRT64 environment. Install the same packages as in the Unix-\/like instructions, but include the ridiculously long prefix to install the UCRT-\/specific ones, i.\+e. you\textquotesingle{}d type\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{pacman\ -\/S\ mingw-\/w64-\/ucrt-\/x86\_64-\/toolchain\ mingw-\/w64-\/ucrt-\/x86\_64-\/cmake\ mingw-\/w64-\/ucrt-\/x86\_64-\/doxygen\ mingw-\/w64-\/ucrt-\/x86\_64-\/graphviz\ mingw-\/w64-\/ucrt-\/x86\_64-\/gnuplot}

\end{DoxyCode}


Once this is done and the UCRT64 binary folder is in your {\ttfamily PATH} environment variable, then you can follow the same build steps as in the Unix-\/like instructions from within a Powershell or Command Prompt.\hypertarget{_building_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Dependencies}{Dependencies}}\label{_building_autotoc_md5}
