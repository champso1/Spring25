\section{Timeline}\label{sec:Timeline}

The core timeline remains the same: the literature review and knowledge of the physics behind what I'm implementing is taking by far the longest time. At this stage, I am starting to highly regret choosing such a complicated process to model, despite it being phenomenally interesting to me. Despite this, I largely understand the core components behind the hard scattering process and the parton showering, at least to leading-order. This roughly corresponds to the Monte Carlo integration for the former and the Sudakov form factor for the latter. If I implement each individual process separately, then all I will need to do is finish the object-oriented structure and plotting of results, and I will have a functioning program. This is far more simple than it sounds, but it is accurate.

The immediate next step is to finish the basics behind the parton showering component. After this point, I will likely approach the aforementioned professor, Dr. Papaefstathiou, and inquire further about a few specifics, during which I will implement the partonic cross sections for a few other processes.
