\section{Timeline}\label{sec:Timeline}

The simulation itself is done, by which I mean the core functionality is in, and, with some poking and prodding, the results I can get are what I set out to achieve. However, there are still a number of other things to do in terms of designing the API for the end user and providing them with as much control as possible in order to satisfy some of the requirements of the project. In particular, the requirements around input sensitivity are the most challenging at the moment, because the strictness of my model due to the limited scope has left very little in the hands of the user, let alone inside the program itself.

The next couple of weeks will be devoted to doing as much of this cleanup work as possible and having some sort of meaningful control on behalf of the user. At this point, some varied inputs can be done over a few simulation runs to satisfy the assignment requirements.
