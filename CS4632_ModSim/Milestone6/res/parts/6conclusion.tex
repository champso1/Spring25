\section{Conclusion}

In this milestone, we examined how my simulation model and its outputs change when varying any of the input parameters. What we have found is that, while we cannot compare exact numerics between \textsc{ColSim} and other programs like \textsc{Pythia8}, we are able to qualitatively compare how the shapes of the distributions and behaviors upon changing input parameters. Doing this, we found that the model behaves very well and exactly what is physically expected and similarly to how a program like \textsc{Pyresias}~\cite{PYRESIAS} (which is most similar in terms of construction) behaves.
