\section{Discussion and Conclusions}

To conclude, in this milestone we have extensively covered the verification of our model against that from other models such as \textsc{MadGraph5} and \textsc{Pythia8}. We found fantastic comparison with the former, but due to the impossibility of constructing identical situations within \textsc{Pythia8} for the parton showering case, we were limited to only qualitative comparisons. However, despite this, these comparisons still yielded great results and indicate that the model is indeed capturing the physics it set out to capture.

Further, we also validated the model itself and ensured that it could survive against spurious input parameters, as well as ensuring that each major component of the model works as intended. With all of this, I believe that the model is ready for the final deliverable.
