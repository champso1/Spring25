\subsection{Philip W. Anderson}
Philip Warren Anderson was a theoretical physicist who made a number of incredibly important contributions to the field of condensed matter physics, as well as paving the way to the understanding of the Higgs mechanism in high energy physics. Further, he is credited with the term \textit{emergence}/\textit{emergent phenomena} within the realm of philisophical science. This was most famously captured in an article named ``More is Different'' written in 1972. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1977 for ``fundamental theoretical investigations of the electronic structure of magnetic and disordered systems'', which significantly aided the development of components for computers.

Much to my dismay as a particle physicist, I have also learned that he advocated against the construction of the Superconducting Super Collider, which would have been a $\qty{40}{\tera\electronvolt}$ proton-proton collider in Texas.
